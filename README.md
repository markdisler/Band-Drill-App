# Band Drill App

This mini-project is the start of a digital medium of viewing marching band drill.

## Objective
To be able to quickly find your spot on the field for a given set in marching band.  We currently have drill sheets that we put on a lanyard (rather cumbersome) and this simplifies that process into an app on a phone.  It would also be helpful to have 3D touch capabilites for futher visualization.  

## Capabilities
Some of the UI sketches have been implemented.  You are able to view the drill for each musical piece that a marching band might perform. Drill contains a list of sets where a set is a position on a football field.  That position includes side-to-side yard line positioning as well as front-to-back hash positioning.

## Future Plans
1. I hope to make a field visualizer where you can see the position on the field relative to other people around you in order to help you find your spot on the field much quicker.
2. I'd like to have a backend in order to sync drill.  My band makes changes to drill as time goes by and it would be neat to be able to push those changes out if this were widely adopted.
